# Blur-Image-Detection
The following Packages were used while developing this model -
        # Matplotlib (https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
        # Numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
        # Python Image Library (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
        # Tensorflow (https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)
        # Keras (https://pypi.org/project/Keras/)
        
All the packages mentioned above can we installed by running the attached notebook. Install Anaconda Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for running the notebook on Jupyter Noteook. 

*Note - I've approached this problem using both transfer learning and normal Convolution method. Transfer learning with mobile achieved 43-56% accuracy while conv got 84-87% validation accuracy & 95-97% training accuracy. The model slightly overfits which can be resolved with more computational resource. The model can be improved further by hyper parameter tuning using grid search and random search, but due to time constraints & lack of computational resources, this is the best I could achieve for the time being.
